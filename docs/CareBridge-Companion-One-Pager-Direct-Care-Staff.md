# CareBridge Companion — Direct‑Care Staff One‑Pager
**What it is, what it isn’t, and what to do when an alert happens**

---

## What CareBridge Companion is
- A supportive check‑in companion that youth can talk to anytime.
- A tool that helps the care team by producing:
  - short summaries of recent check-ins (briefings)
  - safety flags when a message suggests risk

### Important boundary
- **You cannot message youth through CareBridge Companion.**
- Youth only communicate with the companion.

---

## Why it helps in group living
- Youth may open up after hours or between sessions.
- Shifts change; context can get lost.
- Briefings and flags help the team respond **faster and more consistently**.

---

## What you might see
### Briefings (routine)
A short snapshot like:
- “Mood trend: worsening anxiety”
- “Theme: peer conflict”
- “Suggested follow-up: check-in today; monitor after family call”

### Alerts (urgent / safety-related)
Alerts may include:
- risk level (medium/high/critical)
- reason for alert (e.g., self-harm language, abuse disclosure indicators, urgent timing)
- suggested immediate steps based on facility policy

---

## What to do when you receive an alert (facility policy always comes first)
### 1) Acknowledge quickly
- Confirm you received it (or route to the on-call person).

### 2) Check youth safety in person
- Follow your facility’s supervision and safety procedures.
- If the alert indicates immediate danger, escalate immediately per protocol.

### 3) Notify the right people
Depending on facility policy, this may include:
- on-call clinician
- shift supervisor
- safeguarding lead
- program director

### 4) Document actions taken
- Log what you observed and what steps were taken.
- Keep documentation factual and time-stamped.

### 5) Do not investigate alone
- If abuse/exploitation concerns exist, follow mandatory reporting rules and internal procedure.
- Preserve information; avoid confrontation or unofficial questioning.

---

## What NOT to do
- Don’t treat the companion as a clinician or rely on it as a crisis service.
- Don’t delay in-person safety checks because “it might be a false alarm.”
- Don’t share sensitive details beyond “minimum necessary” staff who need to know.

---

## Quick reference: common safe responses (in-person)
- “I’m here with you.”
- “You’re not in trouble.”
- “Let’s make sure you’re safe right now.”
- “We can get the right support together.”

---

## If a youth says “I feel unsafe with a staff member”
- Take it seriously.
- Follow safeguarding policy immediately (supervisor/safeguarding lead).
- Document and escalate per mandatory reporting requirements.
