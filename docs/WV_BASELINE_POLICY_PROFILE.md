# CareBridge Companion — WV Baseline Policy Profile (One Page)
**Purpose:** Establish consistent privacy, safety, and safeguarding defaults for CareBridge Companion in West Virginia youth group living facilities.

---

## 1) System Scope & Boundaries (Non‑Negotiotiables)
- **Youth ↔ Companion only.** No staff member can message any youth through the system.
- CareBridge Companion **supports care**; it does not replace clinical judgment or crisis services.
- Facility defines alert recipients and response expectations.

---

## 2) Access Model (Minimum Necessary by Default)
**Default view for staff/therapists: BRIEFINGS ONLY.**
- Staff and therapists view time‑bounded **briefings** (e.g., last 24h / last 7d).
- Briefings are designed to provide **minimum necessary** information for care coordination.

**Full chat transcripts**
- Not part of routine workflows.
- If transcripts are ever enabled later, they should require **break‑glass** access with:
  - reason required,
  - automatic audit logging,
  - optional safeguarding notification.

---

## 3) Safety Alerts (Youth Safety)
Safety alerts are triggered by youth messages that indicate potential harm (e.g., self‑harm risk, abuse indicators, imminent danger language).

**Facility must configure:**
- Primary recipients (e.g., on‑call clinician, shift supervisor)
- Backup recipients and escalation ladder
- Acknowledgement and response time expectations (SLA)
- Documentation requirements ("action taken" note)

---

## 4) Safeguarding Alerts (Insider Risk / Misuse Prevention)
Because staff cannot message youth inside the system, safeguarding focuses on **access accountability**.

**Safeguarding alerts are sent to the facility-chosen safeguarding lead/supervisor** when suspicious access behavior is detected, such as:
- access attempts outside assigned roles/caseload
- repeated viewing of the same youth without a care need
- after-hours access patterns (facility-defined)
- export/download attempts (if enabled)
- role/permission changes

---

## 5) Auditability & Accountability (Required Controls)
CareBridge Companion should maintain an audit trail that can answer:
- who accessed what
- when access occurred
- whether access was appropriate (assigned role/caseload if applicable)
- whether elevated access (break‑glass) was used
- what actions were taken after alerts

---

## 6) Privacy & Identity-Sensitive Information
- Briefings should minimize unnecessary personal details.
- Identity-sensitive content (including LGBTQ+ disclosures) should be handled with **care and minimum necessary disclosure**, and included explicitly only when relevant to safety/care workflows defined by the facility.

---

## 7) Implementation Checklist (WV Baseline)
- [ ] Briefings-only access enabled for staff/therapists (default)
- [ ] Safety alert recipients configured
- [ ] Safeguarding alert recipients configured (safeguarding lead/supervisor)
- [ ] Response SLAs defined and trained
- [ ] Audit logging enabled and reviewed on a schedule
- [ ] Staff trained on: alert response, documentation, and privacy boundaries
