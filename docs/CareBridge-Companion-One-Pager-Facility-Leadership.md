# CareBridge Companion — Facility Leadership One‑Pager
**A supportive check‑in companion that helps connect youth to care teams.**
Designed for **youth group living facilities** to improve continuity, safety visibility, and documentation quality.

---

## Executive Summary
CareBridge Companion is an on‑site (facility‑controlled) youth support and clinician briefing system. Youth communicate only with the companion (no staff messaging). The platform generates briefings and safety signals to help staff respond earlier and more consistently—especially across shift changes—while maintaining “minimum necessary” information sharing.

---

## Operational Value (Why leadership should care)
### Continuity across shifts
- Staff turnover and shift transitions often disrupt context.
- Briefings give a **consistent snapshot** of the last 24h/7d without reading long logs.

### Earlier risk visibility
- Identifies escalating patterns (e.g., hopelessness language, increased anxiety, urgent timing).
- Helps prioritize outreach and supervision adjustments sooner.

### Documentation support
- Structured incident logs and time‑bounded summaries can reduce documentation burden and improve consistency (with human review).

---

## Risk & Safeguarding (How it reduces exposure)
### Built-in boundaries
- **No staff member can message youth in the system.**
- Prevents private, unmonitored staff↔youth communications within the platform.

### “Minimum necessary” access model
- Staff see **briefings by default**, not full transcripts.
- Identity-sensitive details can be minimized unless required for safety/care.

### Accountability + audit trail (recommended operating standard)
- Tracks access to sensitive records (who viewed what, when).
- Flags suspicious access patterns (unassigned access, after-hours viewing, excessive viewing, export attempts).
- Supports internal investigations with timestamped evidence.

---

## Compliance & Governance (high-level)
CareBridge Companion is designed to support:
- **Role-based access** (least privilege)
- **Auditability** (traceability of sensitive access)
- **Retention controls** (data minimization and policy-aligned retention)
- **Mandatory reporting workflows** (alerts routed to designated recipients)

> Note: Final compliance posture depends on local policy, configuration, and training (HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2/State rules as applicable).

---

## Staffing Impact (what changes, what doesn’t)
### What changes
- Therapists receive **briefings** to prepare for sessions and prioritize outreach.
- Supervisors receive **safety/safeguarding alerts** according to facility-defined rules.
- More consistent handoffs between shifts.

### What doesn’t change
- Clinical decisions remain human-led.
- Crisis response remains facility-driven (CareBridge is not a crisis hotline).
- Direct-care staff still follow existing supervision and safety procedures.

---

## What leadership must define for safe rollout
1. **Alert recipients & escalation path** (on-call clinician, supervisor, safeguarding lead, etc.)
2. **Response time expectations** (acknowledge within X minutes)
3. **Access policy** (briefings-only vs break-glass transcript access)
4. **Training** (how to respond to alerts; boundaries and documentation)
5. **Privacy rules** (how identity-sensitive disclosures are handled)

---

## Recommended Pilot Plan (30–60 days)
- Start with a small cohort (opt-in where appropriate).
- Set alert routing + response SLAs.
- Weekly review: usefulness, false alarms, staff workload.
- Expand only after workflows are stable and staffing coverage is confirmed.
