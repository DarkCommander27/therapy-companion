# CareBridge Companion — WV Alert Response SOP (One Page)
**Audience:** Direct-care staff, supervisors, on-call clinicians, safeguarding lead

---

## A) Key Rule (Always True)
CareBridge Companion alerts require **human follow‑up**. Do not treat the system as a crisis service.

---

## B) Types of Alerts You May Receive

### 1) Safety Alerts (Youth Risk)
Triggered by youth messages suggesting possible harm (examples: self-harm language, abuse indicators, imminent danger phrasing).

**What you do:**
1. **Acknowledge** the alert quickly (per facility expectation).
2. **Check youth safety in person** following facility policy (supervision, observation, wellness check).
3. **Escalate** to on-call clinician/supervisor if risk appears high or immediate.
4. **Document** actions taken (time, steps, outcome). Keep it factual and brief.
5. **Follow mandatory reporting procedures** when applicable (facility policy governs).

### 2) Safeguarding Alerts (Suspicious Access Behavior)
Triggered when the system detects suspicious access patterns (e.g., inappropriate viewing attempts, unusual access timing, permission changes).

**Where it goes:**
- These alerts are routed to the **facility-chosen safeguarding lead/supervisor**.

**What the safeguarding lead/supervisor does:**
1. **Acknowledge** the alert.
2. **Review audit details** (who, what, when, pattern).
3. **Take protective action** if warranted (e.g., supervisor review, restrict access, internal investigation, HR escalation).
4. **Document** what actions were taken and the outcome.

---

## C) What NOT To Do
- Don’t ignore alerts because they "might be a false alarm."
- Don’t share sensitive details broadly—use **minimum necessary** information sharing.
- Don’t conduct informal investigations alone; follow safeguarding and reporting procedures.

---

## D) Quick In‑Person Safety Phrases (Helpful)
- “I’m here with you.”
- “You’re not in trouble.”
- “Let’s make sure you’re safe right now.”
- “We can get the right support together.”

---

## E) Shift Handoff Requirement (Continuity)
If an alert occurs during your shift:
- ensure the next shift receives a brief handoff:
  - youth status
  - actions taken
  - next steps / monitoring plan
  - who has been notified

*This SOP is designed to align with a “briefings-only” access model and facility-chosen alert routing.*
