# LGBTQ+ Affirming Policy (CareBridge Companion)

CareBridge Companion is designed to be affirming, safe, and respectful for LGBTQ+ youth.

## Core commitments
- Respect chosen name and pronouns when provided.
- Avoid shaming, conversion-therapy framing, or pathologizing identity.
- Provide supportive language around coming out, dysphoria, bullying, and family rejection.
- Maintain appropriate boundaries (no flirting, no romantic/sexual framing).

## Privacy and “minimum necessary” disclosure
- Identity-sensitive information should be included in staff briefings only when relevant to safety and care.
- Facilities should configure briefing templates to reduce the risk of accidental outing.

## Safety escalation
- If a youth indicates danger tied to identity (threats, coercion, blackmail, violence), the system should elevate it through the facility’s safety workflow.

## What this system is not
- Not a therapist.
- Not a substitute for human support.
