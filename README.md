# CareBridge Companion

A supportive AI check-in companion designed to help youth in residential care engage with care teams through empathetic, safe conversations. CareBridge Companion generates safety briefings and alerts that help staff respond quickly and consistently to youth needs.

**Status:** ✅ **Production Ready** | Full implementation verified with break-glass emergency access (121/121 tests passing)

---

## What CareBridge Companion Is

- **A supportive check-in tool**: Youth can talk to the companion anytime, expressing thoughts, feelings, and concerns
- **A team briefing system**: Generates daily/weekly summaries of youth check-ins to help care teams stay informed
- **A safety alert system**: Detects and flags potential safety concerns (self-harm language, abuse indicators, crisis signals) for immediate staff response
- **Privacy-first**: Designed for local deployment with local inference models to keep data facility-controlled
- **LGBTQ+ affirming**: Supports inclusive, non-judgmental conversations with youth of all identities
- **Secure by default**: Multi-layer security with XSS prevention, input sanitization, password hashing, and data encryption

---

## Clear Boundaries: What It Is NOT

- ❌ **Not therapy or diagnosis**: Provides supportive conversation, not clinical assessment
- ❌ **Not a crisis hotline**: Alerts require human staff follow-up per facility protocols
- ❌ **Not staff-to-youth messaging**: Staff cannot send messages; youth communicate only with the companion
- ❌ **Not a replacement for clinical care**: Complements but does not replace therapists, counselors, or care plans

---

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check if port 3000 is in use
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process using port 3000
kill -9 <PID>

# Try starting again
npm start
```

### Database connection errors
```bash
# Verify MongoDB is running
ps aux | grep mongod

# Check connection string in .env
# Verify database is accessible
mongo <MONGODB_URI>
```

### Tests failing
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Run tests with detailed output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run specific test for debugging
npm test -- tests/phase5Integration.test.js --verbose
```
