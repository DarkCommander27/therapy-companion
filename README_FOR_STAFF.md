# CareBridge Companion — A Simple Guide for Our Team

## What Is CareBridge Companion?

CareBridge Companion is a supportive AI chatbot tool that helps young people in our care talk about their feelings and concerns **24/7**, in a safe and private space. It's like having a caring listener available anytime—before bed, after a difficult conversation, or whenever a youth needs to talk.

This tool is designed for **all youth**, regardless of their background, immigration status, or life experience. Whether a young person is new to the country, learning English, or carrying experiences that are unique to their migration journey, this system is here to support them with respect and understanding.

The system then helps our care team by:
- Creating short summaries of what youth are experiencing
- Alerting us to safety concerns that need immediate attention
- Helping us plan better support and follow-ups

## How Does It Work?

### **Step 1: Youth Chat with the Companion**
A young person opens the app and talks to the companion—like texting a caring friend. They can share whatever is on their mind.

### **Step 2: The System Listens & Learns**
The companion:
- Listens carefully to what's said
- Identifies the youth's mood and concerns
- Watches for safety red flags (like talk of self-harm or abuse)

### **Step 3: Staff Get Alerts & Summaries**
We receive:
- **Daily briefing**: "What was this youth's mood? What's on their mind?"
- **Safety alert**: "This message suggests they might be at risk—check in now"
- **Weekly summary**: Trends and patterns we should know about

### **Step 4: We Respond**
Staff check on the youth in person, document what we find, and follow our normal safety procedures. The system helps but doesn't replace us—**we stay in charge of all decisions.**

## What CareBridge Companion Is NOT

❌ **Not a therapist** — It doesn't diagnose or treat mental health conditions  
❌ **Not a crisis hotline** — If a youth is in immediate danger, we still follow our emergency procedures  
❌ **Not staff messaging** — Staff cannot message youth through the system  
❌ **Not a replacement for human care** — It helps US care better, but you are what matters most

---

## Key Features Explained Simply

### **Facility Schedules**
The system respects our facility's routine. The companion is available:
- During the day and evening activities
- Before bedtime
- NOT during lights out (unless the facility chooses otherwise)

This helps youth build healthy habits and prevents overuse.

### **Safety Alerts**
If a youth mentions something concerning—like thoughts of hurting themselves, concerns about abuse, or being in immediate danger—**we get notified right away.**

You'll see a message like:
> "⚠️ Sarah's message suggests she might be thinking about self-harm. Check in with her now."

Then you follow our normal safety protocols. You're trained for this—the system just helps you notice faster.

### **Briefings (Summaries)**
Instead of reading every chat message, you get a short summary:
- **Mood trend**: "Getting more anxious over the past week"
- **Main themes**: "Worried about family visit" or "Peer conflict with roommate"
- **What to do**: "Check in today; consider a call to mom before the visit"

### **Privacy & Confidentiality**
- Youth's chats are **private** (conversations are between them and the companion)
- Staff briefings include the **minimum information** needed to help
- Identity-sensitive information (like LGBTQ+ disclosures, family separation concerns, or immigration status) is handled with extra care and confidentiality
- Immigration-related disclosures are protected and kept separate from any official documentation without the youth's consent
- Everything is encrypted and secure

## How to Respond to an Alert

### **When You Get a Safety Alert:**

**1. Stay calm** — The system is helping, not panicking

**2. Check in with the youth in person** — This is the most important step
   - Go talk to them face-to-face
   - Use phrases like: "I heard you might be struggling. I'm here to listen."
   - Be patient if language is a barrier—use translation tools if needed
   - Show genuine care and respect for their unique experiences and background

**3. Follow our facility's safety procedures**
   - Alert your supervisor if needed
   - Escalate to the on-call clinician
   - Document what you observe and do

**4. Don't investigate alone**
   - If there are concerns about abuse or exploitation, involve your safeguarding team
   - Keep it professional and follow mandatory reporting rules

**5. Let supervisors know what happened**
   - Keep them updated so the next shift knows

## Daily Routine

### **Morning Briefing** (If configured)
Check the overnight briefing summary to understand what youth experienced.

### **Throughout the Day**
If you get a safety alert, check the youth in person per our procedures.

### **Shift Handoff**
Tell the next shift:
- What alerts you responded to
- What you observed
- What the youth is working on
- Any ongoing monitoring needed

### **Weekly Review** (Often with supervisor or clinician)
Review weekly summaries to identify trends and plan better support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will the youth know what information we have?**
A: No. The youth knows they're talking to the companion, but they don't see what summaries we get.

**Q: What if the youth doesn't want to use it?**
A: Participation is voluntary. We never force a youth to chat. If they prefer not to, that's okay.

**Q: Does this replace my job?**
A: Absolutely not. You know these youth. The system helps you care better by providing information, but **you make all the decisions.**

**Q: What if I think the system is wrong?**
A: Trust your judgment. If you think an alert is a false alarm, check the youth anyway. Your in-person assessment is what matters most.

**Q: Is this HIPAA-compliant?**
A: Yes. Our IT team made sure all data is protected and secure. Talk to your supervisor for specific details.

**Q: What if a youth asks me about their chats?**
A: You can say: "I see summaries of how you're doing so I can help you better. Your private conversations are between you and the companion." You can also assure them: "You can talk about anything—your feelings, your family, your background, your worries—and it stays private."

**Q: Can I read the full chat messages?**
A: Usually no—you get summaries only. This protects youth privacy. In rare cases, supervisors can access full messages if there's a safety concern and proper authorization.

## Our Commitment

CareBridge Companion is here to **help us care better**—not to spy on or control youth. It works best when:

- We treat it as a helpful tool, not a solution
- We remember that youth are experts on their own lives
- We use the information to support them, not judge them
- We respect privacy and confidentiality
- We follow facility policy and procedures
- **We honor the dignity, culture, and unique journey of every young person**
- **We approach each youth with humility, compassion, and an open heart**
- **We recognize that our role is to listen, support, and advocate—not to change who they are**

### **A Special Note on Welcoming and Understanding**

If you work with youth from immigrant backgrounds—whether they arrived last year or with their families when they were very young—know that your care matters deeply. Many of these young people may have experienced loss, displacement, discrimination, or tremendous resilience in ways we may never fully understand. 

This system is designed to give them a voice and to help *us* listen better. When you read briefings or respond to alerts from these youth:

✨ **Believe them.** Their feelings are real and valid.  
✨ **Respect their journey.** They've survived things that shaped them.  
✨ **Honor their culture.** Encourage them to share their background and identity.  
✨ **Be patient with language.** If they're still learning English, that doesn't mean they don't understand or that their feelings matter less.  
✨ **Recognize trauma.** Many immigrant youth have experienced things that deserve compassion, not judgment.  
✨ **Welcome their whole selves.** Family separation, cultural loss, identity questions—these are all things they need space to process.  

**No youth should ever feel less welcome, less worthy, or less cared for because of where they come from or how they got here.** Your job is to help them feel safe enough to be themselves, exactly as they are.

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

We believe that:
- **All youth belong here**, regardless of immigration status, national origin, race, ethnicity, language, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or family structure
- **There is no "normal" family**—families come in all configurations, and we honor them all
- **Language differences are strengths**—bilingualism is a gift, not a barrier
- **Cultural pride is encouraged**—youth should be able to talk about where they come from
- **Systemic barriers are real**—we work to understand and reduce them, not blame youth for experiencing them
- **Everyone deserves dignity**—no matter their circumstances
- **Love and understanding are universal languages** that transcend all boundaries

If at any point you feel a youth is being treated unfairly based on their background, please speak up. Everyone deserves an ally.
